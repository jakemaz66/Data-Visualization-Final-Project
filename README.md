# Project Title: Spotify Top Songs Data Visualization

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the top streamed songs on Spotify, investigating trends, breakdowns of song types, and metrics associated with top-performing songs. The analysis is conducted using a dataset obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023. The project involves data preparation, processing, and visualization using Jupyter notebooks with Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly. The final results are compiled into a PowerPoint presentation for easy dissemination.

## Project Overview

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about the top streamed songs on Spotify. It includes attributes such as song features, popularity, artists, and release dates. It also includes individual metrics for the song-type like speechiness (number of spoken words) and beats per minute.

### Data Analysis
The analysis involves exploring patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of top-performing songs on Spotify.

### Data Visualization
Various visualization techniques, including box plots, violin plots, and interactive Plotly bar charts, are employed to present the findings in a visually appealing and informative manner.

## Steps Taken

### Data Preparation
- Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- Ensured correct formats, encoding, and handled corrupt values

### Data Processing
- Utilized Jupyter notebooks to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract meaningful insights.

### Visualization Techniques
- Created box plots and violin plots using Seaborn for visualizing the distribution of key song features.
- Generated interactive bar charts using Plotly to showcase trends in streaming metrics.
- Used Seaborn to make bar charts

### Presentation
- Compiled the results and insights into a PowerPoint presentation (attached as a PDF). I then gave the presentation in class
